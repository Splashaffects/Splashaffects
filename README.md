 Hi there, I'm Ashley! ðŸ‘‹
<a href="https://linkedin.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>
Iâ€™m currently working in the field of Client Support Specialist, but I'm looking to explore the different paths within this vast domain of cybersecurity. Iâ€™m particularly interested in becoming a **Security Analyst**, engaging in **Penetration Testing**, developing **Principles of Security Strategies**, or working as a **Security Consultant**.
This is helping me build a solid foundation and gain hands-on experience in the areas I'm passionate about.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate and network with professionals who are already established in the cybersecurity field. If youâ€™re working in any area of interest, Iâ€™d love to connect and gain insights on how to narrow down my focus within cybersecurity
Iâ€™m seeking help with gaining more knowledge about different specializations within cybersecurity to determine what best suits my skills and interests.
You can reach me at: **Mecola.ash95@yahoo.com**  
My pronouns are: **She/Her**.

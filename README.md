- **Security Analyst**
- **Penetration Testing**
- **Principles of Security Strategies**
- **Security Consultant**

This journey is helping me build a solid foundation and gain hands-on experience in areas I'm passionate about.

Additionally, I seek guidance on the different specializations within cybersecurity to determine what best suits my skills and interests.
